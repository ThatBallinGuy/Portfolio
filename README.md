# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The purpose of this website was to be used as a personal portfolio for the projects that I complete and am proud of. This website will be consistantly updated with every new project made during this bootcamp and beyond. Flexboxes are used as the main display type to allow an adaptive display of the content. 

## Usage

You can navigate this webpage by clicking on the links at the top of the screen to go there they are linked. The projects displayed will also redirect you to the repository that each of them are stored on.
